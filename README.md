# smoking-cessation-support

This project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to classify smoking behavior based on various health and demographic indicators. It aims to support the development of targeted smoking cessation programs.

## üß† Objective
- Classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers using health data
- Provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals to design effective intervention strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Classification models: K-NN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity, Specificity
- Chi-square and Point-Biserial correlation for feature selection

## üîç Impact
This model can be used by public health organizations to identify high-risk individuals and deploy personalized interventions to help reduce smoking rates and related health issues.
